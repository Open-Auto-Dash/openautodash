# Open AutoDash #

This app is intended for use in a vehicle as a replacement or adition to the existing dash. Works on most android tablets with Android 8 or newer. This is part of a project that I am doing in my spare time to add a more feature rich and high tech experience to my 2010 Ford Fusion SEL.

## Features
- Phone Key <br>
Yup, you can... ah will be able to use your android phone as a key to start and operate your car. An ignition spoofing device is required such as the all famouse [EvoAll](https://fortin.ca/en/products/evo-series/evo-all/). (Hopefully soon, not tested and proven yet. The phone app [Open AutoDash client for Android](https://github.com/Open-Auto-Dash/OpenAutoClientAndroid) is also part of the project and will act as authentication, and remote start, control of many vehicle functions. Raise, lower windows, Check location, schedual remote start routines, and so on. So far it is just an empty shell. ðŸŸ

## External Pereferal Kit
An external pereferal kit will be made available once I have the design finalized and working. This will be a circuit board that interfaces with your tablet via USB. Containing the SDR Radios for HAM, GMRS, ADSB. Bluetooth sink radio for handsfree calling. ODB2 interface with the vehicle for telemetry data and who knows what else I or you might think of doing. 

## IT'S OPEN SOURCED ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽŠðŸ¥³

For the google maps and temperature to work you will have to edit the file named "api_keys.xml" in the res/values folder and enter your API key. 
```
<resources>
    <string name="google_maps_key" templateMergeStrategy="preserve" translatable="false">YOUR_KEY_HERE</string>
    <string name="open_weather_map_key" translatable="false">YOUR_KEY_HERE</string>
</resources>
```
To generate a key, go to https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/ and generate your free Google Maps API key and enter it in the "YOUR_KEY_HERE" field in the previously mentioned file. For OpenWeatherMap go to https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up and create a key.
